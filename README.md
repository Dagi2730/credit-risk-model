Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
Objective
The goal of Task 2 is to thoroughly explore the dataset to understand its structure, quality, and underlying patterns. This foundational analysis helps uncover insights and guides subsequent feature engineering and modeling steps for the credit risk project.

Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data science workflow. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of the data, visualizing distributions, detecting anomalies, and identifying relationships between variables. This analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebooks to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

Key Activities
The EDA focused on:

Data Structure:
Examined the number of rows, columns, and data types to understand dataset shape and schema.

Summary Statistics:
Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and other metrics to understand feature distributions.

Numerical Feature Distribution:
Visualized using histograms and box plots to detect skewness, outliers, and spread.

Categorical Feature Distribution:
Analyzed category frequencies to identify dominant classes and potential imbalances.

Correlation Analysis:
Explored relationships between numerical features using correlation matrices and heatmaps.

Missing Values:
Checked for missing or null data to plan imputation or cleaning strategies.

Outlier Detection:
Used box plots to identify extreme values that may affect model performance.

🔑 Summary of Insights
✅ No missing values were detected, ensuring data completeness and reducing the need for imputation.

⚠️ Several numerical features show skewed distributions and significant outliers which will require transformation or treatment during preprocessing.

📊 Categorical variables are somewhat imbalanced, highlighting the need for careful encoding and possible resampling techniques.

🤝 Strong correlations among some numerical features were identified, which can inform feature selection and engineering.

📈 The dataset size and quality are adequate for building robust and reliable credit risk models.

Tools and Libraries
Python 3.12

Pandas for data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration

Next Steps
Based on these insights, we will build an automated feature engineering pipeline that transforms raw data into a model-ready format, improving prediction accuracy and interpretability.
